## Hi, I'm Ryan 👋

I am a fourth year Computer Science student at the University of Toronto and connoisseur of frozen 🍕.

I'm interested in Software Engineering and Human Computer Interaction. In my free time, I am building a social networking app, [Matcha Meet](https://matchameet.com). Coming soon to an app store near you!

### Will you press The Button? 🔴

Since you're here, would you like to press *The Button*?

*The Button* is a game where there is a counter that counts upwards and resets whenever anyone presses *The Button* below. Anyone can press *The Button*, at any time and as many times as you want. You will gain the number of points displayed below. Try to get the highest score! This is based off of Reddit's "The Button".
