### Hi, I'm Ryan ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a fourth year Computer Science student at the University of Toronto. I'm interested in Software Engineering and Human Computer Interaction.

- In my free time, I am building a social networking app, [Matcha Meet](https://matchameet.com). Coming soon to an app store near you!
- Big fan of [Dart](https://dart.dev) and [Go](https://golang.org/).
